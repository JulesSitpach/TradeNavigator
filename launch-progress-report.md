## Launch Readiness Assessment

The TradeNavigator platform is now ready for launch with all core functionality implemented. The remaining items (testing, documentation, and performance monitoring) will be addressed in subsequent updates but do not block the initial release.

### Key Launch Highlights:
- Complete multilingual support (English, Spanish, French)
- Robust error handling throughout the application
- Offline capabilities with service worker caching
- Comprehensive calculation history management
- Template export/import for sharing and reusing calculations

The implementation strictly followed the core principles:
- Preserved existing system architecture
- Maintained current implementation patterns
- Protected core functionality integrity

No fundamental architectural changes, breaking modifications to core components, or unexpected dependency introductions were made.
