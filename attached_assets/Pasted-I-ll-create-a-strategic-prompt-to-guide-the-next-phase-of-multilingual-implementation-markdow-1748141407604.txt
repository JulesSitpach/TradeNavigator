I'll create a strategic prompt to guide the next phase of multilingual implementation:

```markdown
# TradeNavigator Multilingual Expansion Blueprint

## Current Multilingual Foundation
- ✓ React-i18next implemented
- ✓ English/Spanish support
- ✓ Stable language switching
- ✓ Local storage persistence

## Comprehensive Internationalization Roadmap

### Translation Coverage Audit
1. Identify Translation Gaps
- Analyze current translation completeness
- Map untranslated components/pages
- Create translation coverage matrix

### Technical Expansion Strategy
1. Translation Management
- Implement namespace-based translations
- Create modular translation files
- Support dynamic content interpolation

2. Language Resource Structure
```
/src
  /locales
    /namespaces
      - common.json
      - navigation.json
      - features.json
      - dashboard.json
    /languages
      /en
      /es
      /future_languages
```

### Advanced Internationalization Features
1. Technical Enhancements
- Pluralization support
- Date/number localization
- Interpolation for dynamic content
- Accessibility language attributes

2. Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of translation resources
- Minimize translation bundle size
- Efficient caching mechanisms

### Language Expansion Preparation
1. Future Language Support
- Prepare for Portuguese, French
- Right-to-left (RTL) language handling
- Unicode and character set considerations

### Monitoring & Quality Assurance
1. Translation Quality Tracking
- Missing translation detection
- Automated translation coverage reports
- User language preference analytics

## Implementation Priorities
1. Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)
- Complete translation coverage audit
- Implement namespace-based translations
- Add interpolation support

2. Short-Term (1-2 Months)
- Prepare infrastructure for additional languages
- Develop translation management workflow
- Implement advanced localization features

## Technical Deliverables
- Comprehensive translation management system
- Scalable language addition process
- Performance-optimized internationalization

Focus: Strategic, technically robust multilingual expansion

Specific Questions:
- Current translation file count?
- Anticipated new language additions?
- Performance benchmarks for current implementation?
```

This prompt provides a comprehensive strategy for expanding your multilingual capabilities, focusing on technical depth, scalability, and future-proofing.

Would you like me to help you break down this strategy into specific, actionable implementation steps for TradeNavigator?
