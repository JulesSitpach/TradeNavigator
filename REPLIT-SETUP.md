# TradeNavigator - Replit Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start for Replit

This guide helps you get TradeNavigator running smoothly in your Replit environment.

### Current Project Status
âœ… **Preserved Architecture**: All existing functionality maintained  
âœ… **Core Features**: Fully functional trade analysis tools  
âœ… **Multilingual Support**: i18n system operational  
âœ… **Database**: Configured with PostgreSQL  

### Replit Configuration Fixed

The following issues have been resolved:

1. **Port Configuration**: Corrected port mapping for proper service access
2. **Workflow Integration**: Enhanced workflows for development and production
3. **Environment Setup**: Optimized for Replit's execution environment
4. **Build Process**: Streamlined build and deployment scripts

### Available Workflows in Replit

After saving your changes, you should now see these options in the Replit dropdown:

- **Development Server** - Start the development environment
- **Build & Production** - Build and run production version
- **Database Setup** - Initialize database schema
- **Type Check** - Run TypeScript validation

### Manual Commands

If workflows aren't appearing, you can run these commands in the Shell:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up database
npm run db:push

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

### Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing limited options:

1. **Refresh the Replit page** after saving the `.replit` file
2. **Clear browser cache** and reload
3. **Use the Shell tab** to run commands directly
4. **Check the Console tab** for any error messages
